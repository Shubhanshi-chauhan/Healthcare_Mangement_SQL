## ❓Problem Statement:
A hospital wants to implement a Patient Management System to efficiently manage patient records, doctor appointments, treatment history, and hospital performance metrics. The system should allow for the storage of electronic health records (EHR), patient demographics, medical diagnoses, treatment history, and doctor information. Additionally, it should support analysis of patient demographics, disease prevalence, treatment outcomes, and hospital performance metrics.

## ✔️Solution Overview:
We'll design and implement a relational database system to store patient and doctor information, medical records, and treatment details. We'll utilize SQL queries to perform various analyses such as patient demographics, disease prevalence, treatment outcomes, and hospital performance metrics.


## 🎯Task:
Database Schema:
1. Patients: Stores patient demographics.
2. Doctors: Stores doctor information and specialization.
3. MedicalRecords: Stores medical records, including admission dates, discharg dates, diagnoses, treatments, and associated doctor IDs.

### ⭐Final Analysis:
● Count of Male vs. Female Patients.

● Percentage of Male and Female Patients.

● Top 5 Most Common Diagnoses.

● Average Length of Hospital Stay.

● Top 3 Doctors Treating the Most Patients.
